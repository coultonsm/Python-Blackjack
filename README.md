# Python-Blackjack (CSCI 124 Final Project)
Blackjack in Python w/ Tkinter 

This project uses the tkinter library to create a functional GUI frontend 
for the card game Blackjack. The backend uses objects to store data 
about player's hands, chips, and status in the round.

To run the project:
1. Open the extracted folder in VScode
2. Click "Terminal" and then "New Terminal"
3. Enter these commands:
    
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

This creates a virtual environment within this program's folder
which allows for the requirements to be installed without affecting
your global Python installation.

    python blackjack.py

This command launches the game and awaits for user input.

This game was designed around the use of a 1080p monitor.
The GUI may scale a little small if running on a 1440p/4K screen.
